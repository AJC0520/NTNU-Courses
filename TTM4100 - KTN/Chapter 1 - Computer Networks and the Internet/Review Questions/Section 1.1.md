#### What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several different types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?

A host is any device connected to a network that has an IP address. It can send and receive data over the network. Hosts include all devices that participate in the communication process.

>[!tip] Key Distinction
>All end systems are hosts, but not all hosts are end systems. Routers and switches are hosts, but not end systems because they forward data instead of being the origin or endpoint


Different type of end systems:
- Desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, servers, smart tvs, gaming consoles

A web server is an end system, it is the endpoint that serves web pages and other content in response to client requests. 

#### Describe the protocol that might be used by two people having a telephonic conversation to initiate and end the conversation, i.e., the way that they talk.

Initiation phase:
- A dials B's phone number. (initiate)
- B hears the ring and answers. (acknowledge)
- Both say "Hello" (greeting)
- "Hi how are you?" (purpose of call)

Conversation phase:
* One speaks, the other listen. Taking turns signalled by pauses or questions.
* If a party doesn't understand or hear, they may request clarification

Call termination
- One party signals that they need to end the call
- The other party acknowledge (confirmation)
- Saying goodbye (closing exchange)
- One hang up the phone (disconnect)

The protocol:
* Turn taking ensures that only one speaks at a time
* Verbal signals like "okay" confirm receipt of information
* Repeating information if needed
* Cues to end conversation
#### Why are standards important for protocols?

Standards ensures consistency, compatability and interoperability between system, devices and networks. Without standards, networks would be fragmented, devices would fail to communicate and the growth of global networks like the internet would be limited.
