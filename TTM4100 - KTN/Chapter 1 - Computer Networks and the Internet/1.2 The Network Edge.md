### 1.2.1 Access Networks

##### DSL and cable
Digital Subscriber Line Internet Access is typically obtained from the same local telephone company that provides its wired local phone access. This means that when DSL first is used, a customers telco is also its ISP.

Each customers DSL model uses the existing telephone line exchange data with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the teleco CO. 

The home DSL modem takes digital data and translate it to high-frequency tones from transmission over telephone wires to the CO. The analog signals from many such houses are then translated back into digital format at the DSLAM.

The telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies.:

>[!INFO]
>A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50kHz to 1 MHz band
>A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to the 50 kHz band
>An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band

This makes the single DSL link appear as if there were three separate links. So that a phone call and Internet connection can share the DSL link at the same time.

On the customer side, a splitter separates the data and telephone signals arriving to the home and forwards the data signal to the DSL modem. On the telco side, in the CO, the DSLAM separates the data and phone signals and sends the data into the Internet. Thousands of households connects to a single DSLAM.

DSL standards define multiple transmission rates like:
Downstream of 24 Mbs and 52Mbs.
Upstream rates of 3.5 Mbps and 16 Mbps.
The newest ones provides for upstream plus downstream rates of 1Gbps

DSL is expressly designed for short distances and if a residence is not located within 5 to 10 miles of the CO, often others alternatives are used.

##### Cable Internet Access (makes use of cable tv cable infrastructure)

 Fiber optics are used to connect to node junctions, where coaxial cables is used to reach homes. Each node junction typically supports 500 to 5000 homes. 

Since both fiber and coaxial cable are used, it can be referred to as hybrid fiber coax (HFC)

Cable internet used cable modems, which can be connected to the home PC through an Ethernet Port. At the cable end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS) servers a similar function as the DSLAM in a DSL network.

Cable modems divide HFC-network into two channels, one upstream and one downstream. The access is typically asymmetric like with DSL where the downstream channel is allocated a higher transmission rate than the upstream channel.

Cable internet access operates as a shared broadcast medium, which means that all downstream packets from head end are sent to every home, and all upstream packets from homes go to the head end. The result:
- Multiple users downloading simultaneously share the aggregate downstream rate, reducing individual speeds.
- With few active users, web pages may load at the full downstream rate, as requests are infrequent and staggered.
- A distributed multiple access protocol is required to coordinate upstream transmissions and avoid collisions.

There are multiple technologies for optical distribution in FTTH:
- Direct fiber: each home has a deticated fiber from the CO
- Passive optimal networks (PONs)
	- A splitter near homes combines fibers for up to 100 homes onto a shared fiber to the CO
	- The optical line terminator (OLT) at the CO handles signal conversion and connects to the Internet
	- Each home has an optical network terminator (ONT) connected to the splitter
	- Similar to cable, packets from the OLT are replicated at the splitter
