#### 1.1.1 Nuts-and-bolts description:
*Internet is the basic hardware and software components that make up the Internet. 
- All devices that are being hooked up to the internet are called **hosts** or **end systems.** 
- The end systems are connected by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches.** 
- Different links can transmit data at different rates. The transmission rate of a link is measured in bits/second.
- The sending end system segments data and adds header bytes to each segment. The package **(packets)**  are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.

###### Packet switches
Takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of it outgoing communication links.

Two main types today:
- Link-layer switches which is typically used in access networks.
- Routers switches which is typically used in the network core.

The sequence of communication links and packet switches are traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path through the network.

###### Internet service providers (ISPs)
End systems access the internet through ISPs:
- Residential ISPs (local cable or telephone companies)
- Corporate ISPs
- University ISPs
- ISPs that provide WiFi in public places such as airports, hotel and cafes
- Cellular data ISPs

Each ISP is a network of packet switches and communication links.
ISPs provide Internet access to content providers so that servers can connect directly to the internet.

There are different tiers of ISPs.
An upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic-links.
All ISP network run the IP protocol.

##### Protocols
Protocols control the sending and receiving information within the Internet. **Transmission Control Protocol** (TCP) and the **Internet Protocol** (IP) are the two most important protocols in the Internet.

### 1.1.2 Services description
The internet is a networking infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications. 

### 1.1.3 What is  a protocol?
![[Pasted image 20250109125036.png]]
All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol.

Examples:
- Hardware-implemented protocols in two computers that are connected physically controls the flow of bits on the "wire" between the two network interface cards.
- Congestion-control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted between the sender and receiver.
- Protocols in routers determine a packet's path from source to destination.

>[!DEFINITION]
>A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.
