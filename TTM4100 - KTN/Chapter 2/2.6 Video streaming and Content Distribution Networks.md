Stream video traffic: major consumer of internet bandwith (80% of residential ISP)

Challenge: scale - how to reach 1B users?
Challenge: heterogenity:
- Different users have different capabilities (wired versus mobile, bandwidth rich versus bandwidth poor)
Solution: distributed, application-level infrastructure.

#### Streaming stored video:
Main challenges:
- Server-to-client bandwidth will vary over time, with changing network congestion levels (in house, access network, network core, video server)
- Packet loss, delay due to congestion will delay playout, or result in poor video quality.
- Continous playout constraint:
	- During client video playout, playout timing must match original timing
		- But network delays are variable (jitter) so will need client-side buffer to match continuous playout constraint.

Other challenges:
- client interactivity, pause, fast-forward, rewind, jump through video
- video packets may be lost, retransmitted.

#### Streaming multimedia: DASH
server:
- divides video file into mulitple chunks
- each chunk encoded at multiple different rates
- different rate encodings stored in different files.
- files replicated in various CDN nodes.
- manifest file: provides URLs for different chunks
client:
- periodically esitmates server-to-client bandwidth
- consulting manifest: requests one chunk at a time
	- chooses max coding rate sustainable given current bandwidth
	- can choose different coding rates at different points in time and from different servers

"intelligence at client" - client determines
* when to request chunk (so that buffer starvation or overflow does not occur)
* what encoding rate to request
* where to request chunk from URL server that is "close" to client or has high available bandwidth.

#### Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)
