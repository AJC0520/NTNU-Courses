#### Two socket types for two transport services:
- UDP: unreliable datagram
- TCP: reliable, byte stream-oriented

### Socket programming with UDP:
No connection between client and server.
No handshaking before sending data.
Sender explicity attaches IP destination address and port # to each packet.
Receiver extracts sender IP address and port# from received packet.

UDP: transmitted data may be lost or received out-of-order.

#### Socket programming with TCP
Client must contact server:
- Server process must first be running
- Server must have created socket (door) that welcomes clients contact.
Client contacts server by:
- Creating TCP socket, specifiying IP address, port number of server process.
- When client creates socket: client TCP establishes connection to server TCP

>[!Important]
> When contacted by client, server TCP creates new socket for server process to communicate with that particular client. This allows server to talk with  multiple clients.
 
Application viewpoint -> TCP provides reliable, in-order byte-stream transfer (pipe) between client and server processes.
