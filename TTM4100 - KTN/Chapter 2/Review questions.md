### 2.1
#### List five non-proprietary Internet applications and the application-layer protocols that they use.


R2. What is the difference between network architecture and application architecture?

R3. For a communication session between a pair of processes, which process is
the client and which is the server?

R4. Why are the terms client and server still used in peer-to-peer applications?

R5. What information is used by a process running on one host to identify a process
running on another host?
R6. What is the role of HTTP in a network application? What other components
are needed to complete a Web application?
R7. Referring to Figure 2.4, we see that none of the applications listed in Figure
2.4 requires both no data loss and timing. Can you conceive of an application
that requires no data loss and that is also highly time-sensitive?
R8. List the four broad classes of services that a transport protocol can provide.
For each of the service classes, indicate if either UDP or TCP (or both) provides
such a service.
R9. Recall that TCP can be enhanced with TLS to provide process-to-process
security services, including encryption. Does TLS operate at the transport
layer or the application layer? If the application developer wants TCP to be
enhanced with TLS, what does the developer have to do?
