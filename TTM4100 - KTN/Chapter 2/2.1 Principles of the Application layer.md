#### Client-server paradigm
- Server
	- Always on host
	- Permanent IP address
	- Often in data centres, for scaling
- Clients
	- Contact, communicate with the server
	- May be intermittently connected
	- May have dynamic IP addresses
	- do not communicate directly with each other
	- examples: http, imap, ftp

#### Peer-peer architecture
- No always-on server
- arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers 
- peers are intermittently connected and change ip addresses. (P2P file sharing
- 

#### Processes communicating
- process: program running within a host
	- within same host, two processes communicate using inter-process communication
	- processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages


#### Sockets
process sends/receives messages to/from its socket
sockets analogous to door
- sending processes shoves message out door
- sending process relies on transport infrastructure on the other side of door to deliver message to socket at receiving process.
- two sockets involved: one on each side.

#### Addressing processes
- to receive messages, process must have identifier
- host device has unique 32-bit IP address.

* identifiers include both IP address and port numbers associated with process on host.
	* Port number example:
	* HTTP server: 80
	* mail server: 25
To send HTTP messages to gaia.cs.usmass.edu web server:
ip address: xxx.xx
port number: 80


### An application-layer protocol defines:
* types of messages exchanged, like request and response
* message syntax
	* what field in messages & how fields are delineated
* message semantics
	* meaning of information in fields.

- rules for when and how processes send & respond to messages

two types of protocols:
- open protocols
	- defined in RFCs, everyone has access to protocol definition
	- allows for interoperability
	- e.g., HTTP, SMTP
- proprietary protocols:
  e.g., Skype, Zoom

### What transport services does an app need?

- data integrity
	- some apps(file transfer, web apps) require 100% reliable data transfer
	- other apps (audio) can tolerate some loss
- timing
	- some apps(internet telephony, interactive games) require low delay to be affective
- throughput
	- some apps (multimedia) require minimum amount of throughput to be effective
	- other apps(elastic apps) make user of whatever throughput they get.
- security
	- encryption, data integrity

#### Internet transport protocols services:

##### TCP 
- reliable transport between sending and receiving process.
- flow control: sender won't overwhelm receiver
- congestions control: throttle sender when network overloaded
- connection-oriented: setup required between client and servers processes
- does not provide: timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security

##### UDP
* unreliable data transfer between sending and receiving process
* does not provide: reliabality, flow control, congestion, control, timing, throughput, guarantee, security, or connection setup.


#### Securing TCP
- vanilla TCP & UDP sockets:
	- no encryption
	- cleartext passwords sent into socket traverse Internet in cleartext
- Transport layer Security (TLS)
	- provides encrypted TCP connections
	- data integrity
	- end-point authentication
