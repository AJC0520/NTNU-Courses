##### Q1.1.1 Circuit switching and packet switching have many differences. Which of the following is/are correct? 

a) While a circuit-switched network can guarantee a certain amount of end-to-end bandwidth for the duration of a call, typically packet-switched networks cannot. 

b) Most packet-switched networks today (including the Internet) can make end-to-end guarantees for bandwidth. 

c) Typically, the delay variation among packets/messages in a circuit-switched network is smaller than that in a packet-switched network.

d) The costs for dedicated resources in packet-switched network are usually higher than the costs for resources in circuit-switched network. 

e) In circuit-switched networks, the bandwidth is shared among the users and allocated only when data needs to be transmitted. It has a better bandwidth efficiency than in packet-switched networks.
