#### Multiplexing at sender
handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header (later used for demultiplexing)

#### Demultiplexing at receiver
use header info to deliver received segments to correct socket

#### How demultiplexing works
* Host receives IP datagrams
	- Each datagram has source IP address, destionation IP address.
	- each datagram carries one transport-layer segment
	- each segment has source destination port number
- Host uses IP addresses & port numbers to direct segment to appropriate socket.

#### Connectionless demultiplexing in UDP
When creating a socket, must specify host-local port #:

when creating datagram to send into UDP socket, must specify:
- destination IP address.
- destination port #

when receiving host receives UDP segment:
- checks destination port # in segment
- directs UDP segment to socket with that port #

#### Connection-oriented demultiplexing
* TCP socket identified by 4 tuple
	* source IP address
	* source port number
	* dest IP address
	* dest port number

- Demux: receiver uses all four values to direct segment to appropriate socket.
- Server may support many simultaneous TCP sockets:
	- each socket identified by its own 4-tuple
	- each socket associated with a different connecting client
