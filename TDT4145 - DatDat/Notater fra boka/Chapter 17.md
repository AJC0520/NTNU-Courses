The all-or-none property of transactions are referred to as **atomicity**.

The actions the DBMS takes to ensure that transactions operate properly without interference from concurrently executing database statements is referred to as **isolation**.

A transactions actions ability to persist across crashes is referred to as **durability**

**Consistency:** execution of a transaction in isolation preserves the consistency of the database.
