(a) gcd(23, 29) 
	1
(b) gcd(893, 703) 
	 19
(c) gcd(1045, 77)
	11

3.
(a) 35 mod 31 
	35 = 31 * 1 + 4
(b) 3 mod 1000 
	3 = 1000 * 0 + 3
(c) 65 mod 21 
	65 = 21 * 3 + 2
(d) 236 mod 5 
	236 = 5 * 47 + 1
(e) 123 mod 3
	123 = 3 * 41 + 0

4.

(a) 3^-1 mod 31 
	21
(b) 21^-1 mod 91
	ingen invers
(c) 39^-1 mod 195
		176
5.
	for addition: check for each number a of there exist some number b so that a + b = 0
		this works

For mulitplication: check that for each non-zero number a, if there exists a number, b so that a * b = 1 (mod 5) 
this also works for z5


6.

(b) there are 4 elements in z12*. co-primes 1,5,7,11. No generator
