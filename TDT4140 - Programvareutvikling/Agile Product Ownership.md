capacity = stories per week
each story has an automated acceptance test

yesterdays weather
PO decides what features that shall be delivered next

Kanban way, limit work in progress
WIP limit. Whenever one story is finished, accept another one
Q in front of the team is product backlog, needs to be managed. Best way is for PO to say "no". PO also decides sequencing.

No correlation between complexity of feature and ROI. Guessing game to find out what features are most valuable. At beginning of a project, guesses will usually be bad.
