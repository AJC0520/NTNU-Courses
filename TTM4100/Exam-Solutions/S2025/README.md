**Q1.1.3 Routing versus forwarding. Choose one of the following two definitions that makes the correct distinction between routing versus forwarding.**
a) Forwarding is the local action of moving arriving packets from router‚Äôs input link to appropriate
router output link, while routing is the global action of determining the source-destination paths
taken by packets.
b) Routing is the local action of moving arriving packets from router‚Äôs input link to appropriate
router output link, while forwarding is the global action of determining the source-destination
paths taken by packets.

**Q1.1.4 What is a network of networks? When we say that the Internet is a ‚Äúnetwork of networks,‚Äù we mean? Check all that apply.**
a) The Internet is the largest network ever built.
b) The Internet is made up of a lot of different networks that are interconnected to each other.
c) The Internet is the fastest network ever built.

**Q.1.1.5 Computing Packet Transmission Delay. Consider the network shown in the figure below, with three links, each with the specified transmission rate and link length. Assume the length of a packet is 8000bits. What is the transmission delay at link 2?**

![image.png](image.png)

a) 8x10-5 secs
b) .00096 secs
c) 100 secs
d) 12,500 secs
e) 12.5 secs

<aside>
üìå

Transmission rate = L/R

L = 8000bits

R = 100Mbps = 100 000 000 bits/s

8000/100 000 000 = 0.00008

</aside>

**Q.1.1.6 What is "encapsulation"? Which of the definitions below describe what is meant by the term "encapsulation"?**

a) Computing the sum of all of the bytes within a packet and placing that value in the packet header
field.
b) Determining the name of the destination host, translating that name to an IP address and then
placing that value in a packet header field.
c) Taking data from the layer above, adding header fields appropriate for this layer, and then placing
the data in the payload field of the ‚Äúpacket‚Äù for that layer.
d) Receiving a ‚Äúpacket‚Äù from the layer below, extracting the payload field, and after some internal
actions possibly delivering that payload to an upper layer protocol.
e) Starting a transport layer timer for a transmitted segment, and then if an ACK segment isn‚Äôt
received before the timeout, placing that segment in a retransmission queue

<aside>
üìå

Encapsulation refers to how network layers interact:

- A layer takes the data from the layer above.
- It adds its own header (and sometimes footer).
- This whole package becomes the payload for the layer below.

It happens at each layer of the network stack (application ‚Üí transport ‚Üí network ‚Üí data link).

**Q.1.1.7 Performance: Maximum Throughput. Consider the network shown below, with a sending server on the left, sending packets to two different client receivers on the right. The sender is sending packets to the receivers over separate TCP connections. Assume that the link with capacity R1 is fairly shared (as we've seen is done via TCP) between the two sessions. The links have transmission rates of R1 = 200 Mbps. Assume initially that R2 = R3 = 25 Mbps. Suppose each packet is 1 Mbit in size. What is the maximum end-to-end throughput achieved by each session, assuming both sessions are sending at the maximum rate possible?**

![image.png](image%201.png)

a) 25 Mbps
b) 100 Mbps
c) 50 Mbps
d) 1 Mbit
e) 200 Mbps

<aside>
üìå

Maximum throughput is decided by the bottleneck in the link. 

Each session gets 100mbps from R1 (200/2).

Both R2 and R3 has 25 mbps.

R2 and R3 are therefore the bottlenecks with 25mbps.

</aside>

---

**Q.1.1.8 Performance: End-to-end delay. Consider the scenario shown below, with 10 different servers (four shown) connected to 10 different clients over ten three-hop paths. The pairs share a common middle hop with a transmission capacity of R = 200 Mbps. Each link from a server has to the shared link has a transmission capacity of RS = 25 Mbps. Each link from the shared middle link to a client has a transmission capacity of RC = 50 Mbps**

![image.png](image%202.png)

**Now consider the three-hop path from Server-10 to host-10, assuming the values of Rs, Rc, and R given above. Assume also that a packet is 1000 bits long, and that each link has a propagation delay of 100 microseconds. You can assume that queueing delay and nodal processing delays are zero. What is the total amount of time from when a server starts sending a packet until a host completely receives that packet?**
a) 325 microseconds
b) 365 microseconds
c) 735 microseconds
d) 450 microseconds
e) 350 microseconds
f) 555 microseconds

<aside>
üìå

There are 3 links, Rs, Rc and R, so 300 microseconds in propagation delay

Transmission delay from server = 1000/25 000 000 = 40 microseconds

Transmission delay in shared link = 1000/200 000 000 = 5 microseconds

Transmission delay from middle hop = 1000/50 000 000 = 20 microseconds

300 + 40 + 20 + 5 = 365 microseconds.

</aside>

---

**Q.1.1.9 Performance: Link Utilization. Consider the scenario below where 4 TCP senders are connected to 4 receivers. The servers transmit to the receiving hosts at the fastest rate possible (i.e., at the rate at which the bottleneck link between a server and its destination is operating at 100% utilization, and is fairly shared among the connections passing through that link).**

![image.png](image%203.png)

**Suppose that R = 1 Gbps and RC is 300 Mbps and Rs is 200 Mbps. Assuming that the servers are sending at their maximum rate possible, enter the link utilizations for the client links (whose rate is Rc) below. What is the utilization of the client links, whose rate is RC? Enter your answer as a decimal, of the form 1.00 (if the utilization is 1, or 0.xx if the utilization is less than 1, rounded to the closest xx).**

<aside>
üìå

The shared link R can support a total of 1000 Mbps. If all servers send data simultaneously, this bandwidth is shared among the 4 hosts.

Each client link Rc supports up to 300 Mbps, but since the shared link R can only provide 250 Mbps to each host, the effective maximum rate to each host is limited to 250 Mbps.

However, each server is transmitting at a rate of Rs=200 Mbps, which is below this limit. Therefore, the maximum achievable rate per server-host pair is 200 Mbps.

This means that the link utilization is 200/300 = 0.67

**Q1.2.4 Why Web Caching? Which of the following are advantages of using a web cache? Select one or more answers.**
a) Caching generally provides for a faster page load time at the client, if the web cache is in the
client‚Äôs institutional network, because the page is loaded from the nearby cache rather than from
the distant server.
b) Caching allows an origin server to more carefully track which clients are requesting and receiving
which web objects.

**Q 1.2.9 Phases of TCP congestion control. Consider the figure below, which plots the evolution of TCP's congestion window at the beginning of each time unit (where the unit of time is equal to the RTT). In the abstract model for this problem, TCP sends a "flight" of packets of size cwnd at the beginning of each time unit. The result of sending that flight of packets is that either (i) all packets are ACKed at the end of the time unit, (ii) there is a timeout for the first packet, or (iii) there is a triple duplicate ACK for the first packet. During which of the following intervals of time is TCP performing slow start?**

![image.png](image%204.png)

a) [1,3]
b) [4,15]
c) 16
d) 17
e) 18
f) [22,24]
g) None of the above

<aside>
üìå

A slow start increases exponetially. The congestion window starts small, for every ACK, TCP increases the cwnd by 1 segment. Since each ACK corresponds to sucsessfully received data , the cwnd doubles each RTT. After reaching the threshold (sstresh) it switches to congestion avoidance, where it grows linearly.

Comment to the graph(unrelated to the question): the graph goes back to 0 each time there is detected a timeout and restarts the whole process. If it detects duplicate ACKs ‚Üí it only halves the cwnd (as shown in the graph.

Link layer:

- Takes raw bits from the physical layer and groups them into frames with headers and trails to organize data.
- Uses MAC addresses to identify devices on the same local network segment.
- Error detection (like CRC)
- Manage pace of data transmission

knows it can then send without collisions.
b) A CTS allows a receiver to let the sender (who sent that RTS) know that it (the receiver) has
enough buffers to hold a frame transmitted by that sender
c) A CTS that is sent allows a receiver to force other nodes (other than the intended sender who sent
the RTS) to refrain from transmitting, thus allowing the sender who sent the RTS to then transmit
a frame with less likelihood of a collision.

If a node hears two simultaneous transmissions at a time, the messages interfere at that receiver, even though they may not interfere at other receivers, where only one of the messages is heard. Suppose now that each node has an infinite supply of messages that it wants to send to each of the other nodes. If a message‚Äôs destination is not an immediate neighbor, then the message must be relayed. For example, if A wants to send to D, a message from A must first be sent to B, which then sends the message to C, which then sends the message to D. Time is slotted, with a message transmission time taking exactly one time slot, e.g., as in slotted Aloha. During a slot, a node can do one of the following: (i) send a message (ii) receive a message (if exactly one message is being sent to it), (iii) remain silent. As always, if a node hears two or more simultaneous transmissions, a collision occurs and none of the transmitted messages are received successfully. You can assume here that there are no bit-level errors, and thus if exactly one message is heard at a receiver, it will be received correctly at that receiver.**

**Suppose now that an omniscient controller (e.g., a controller that knows the state of every node in the network) can command each node to do whatever it (the omniscient controller) wishes, that is, to send a message, to receive a message, or to remain silent.**

1. **Given this omniscient controller, what is the maximum rate at which messages can be transferred from C to A, given that there are no other messages between any other source/destination pairs?**
a) 0.5 messages/slot (i.e., 1 message every two slots).
b) 1 message/slot.
c) 2 messages/slot.
d) 0.25 messages/slot (i.e., one message every four slots).
e) None of the above.

C‚ÜíA is sent via B. 

Slot1:  C‚ÜíB
Slot2: B‚ÜíA, 

So 1 message every two slots.

1. **Suppose now that A sends messages to B, and D sends messages to C. What is the combined maximum rate at which data messages can flow from A to B and from D to C?**
a) 0.5 messages/slot (i.e., 1 message every two slots).
b) 1 message/slot.
c) 2 messages/slot.
d) 0.25 messages/slot (i.e., one message every four slots).
e) None of the above.

A‚ÜíB and D‚ÜíC can be sent at the same time since there will be no interferance. 

Slot1: A‚ÜíB, D‚ÜíC

So its 2 message/slot.

1. **Suppose now that A sends messages to B, and C sends messages to D. What is the combined maximum rate at which data messages can flow from A to B and from C to D?**
a) 0.5 messages/slot (i.e., 1 message every two slots).
b) 1 message/slot.
c) 2 messages/slot.
d) 0.25 messages/slot (i.e., one message every four slots).
e) None of the above

A‚ÜíB and C‚ÜíD  can not happen at the same time since B would hear both and C

Slot1: A‚ÜíB
Slot2: C‚ÜíD

So 1 message per slot.

1. **Overlapping wireless senders with ACKs. Now suppose we are again in the wireless scenario, and that for every data message sent from source to destination, the destination will send an ACK message back to the source (e.g., as in TCP). Also suppose that each ACK message takes up one slot. What is the maximum rate at which data messages can be transferred from C to A, given that there are no other messages between any other source/destination pairs? [Note that successful ACKs do not count towards data message throughput].**
a) 0.5 messages/slot (i.e., 1 message every two slots).
b) 1 message/slot.
c) 2 messages/slot.

d) 0.25 messages/slot (i.e., one message every four slots).
e) None of the above.

C ‚ÜíA happens via B.

Slot1: C‚ÜíB

Slot2: B‚ÜíA

Slot3: A‚ÜíB (ACK)

Slot4: B‚ÜíC (ACK)

1 message per 4 slots.

**Suppose N people want to communicate with each other using symmetric key encryption. All
communication between any two people is visible to all other people in this group and no other person in this group should be able to decode their communication. How many keys are required in the system as a whole?**
a) N**N
b) 2**N-1
c) N*(N-1)
d) N*(N-1)/2
e) None of the above

<aside>
üìå

N people needs to communicate with N-1, they share the key so its divided by 2
